*A game with tangible artifacts for use as a student union activity.*

**[Web page explaining results, concept and design process. Made for idxpo 2021, an exhibition where tha game was played and showcased.](http://idxpo.se/current/group_8/index.html)**


## Background

#### What:
A game of Hide and Seek, where the players use pairs of tangible tokens. They hide the small token and use the large token to get information as of the location of the hidden token.

#### Why:
Being an activity that is easy to understand, and that can be played without the use of language, it can function as an ice-breaker and student union activity for foreign and national students.

#### For whom:
Students, new and old, foreign and national.

#### How we have adopted journaling to the modern lifestyle:
Talking to people, we understood that allocating time to journal, either in the morning or evening, was one of the main thresholds of starting of journaling. Research also suggests that, on the average, people pick up their mobile phones [around 60 times per day](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/21/cellphone-screen-time-average-habits) and about half of the time spent on their phone, [they spend on social media platforms](https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref). That indicates that people, on the average, have a lot of idle time throughout the day.
