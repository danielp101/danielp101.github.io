*A game with tangible artifacts for use as a student union activity.*

## Background

### What:
A game of Hide and Seek, where the players use pairs of tangible tokens. They hide the small token and use the large token to get information as of the location of the hidden token.

### Why:
Being an activity that is easy to understand, and that can be played without the use of language, it can function as an ice-breaker and student union activity for foreign and national students.

### For whom:
Students, new and old, foreign and national.

### How it's played
Players are given a large token and a small token. All players hide their small tokens. When all player's small tokens are hidden everyone can start looking for each others hidden tokens. If two players pair their large tokens, both of the large tokens will emit a light signal showing the proximity to a certain small token, mapped to that specific combination of large tokens. When a player finds a small token they have to return it to its owner. Each small token has a symbol underneath it, which should correspond to the symbol on the owners large token.

### How it works
Through GPS the distance from the large token to the hiding place of the small token is calculated and makes the large token emit a LED-light signal. The pairing of two large tokens is done through WiFi.

 We used Arduino boards with suitable modules and components to accomplish this.
