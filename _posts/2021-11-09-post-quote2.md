**[Web page explaining results, concept and design process. Made for idxpo 2021, an exhibition where tha game was played and showcased.](http://idxpo.se/current/group_8/index.html)**


## Background

#### What:
A game of Hide and Seek, where the players use pairs of tangible tokens. They hide the small token and use the large token to get information as of the location of the hidden token.

#### Why:
By adapting journaling methods to the modern on-the-move lifestyle, more people will be able to reap the benefits of journaling.

#### For whom:
The target group for the Boomerang application are people who would like to journal but are for some reason not doing so.

#### How we have adopted journaling to the modern lifestyle:
Talking to people, we understood that allocating time to journal, either in the morning or evening, was one of the main thresholds of starting of journaling. Research also suggests that, on the average, people pick up their mobile phones [around 60 times per day](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/21/cellphone-screen-time-average-habits) and about half of the time spent on their phone, [they spend on social media platforms](https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref). That indicates that people, on the average, have a lot of idle time throughout the day.
