*A game with tangible artifacts for use as a student union activity.*

**[Web page explaining results, concept and design process. Made for idxpo 2021, an exhibition where tha game was played and showcased.](http://idxpo.se/current/group_8/index.html)**


## Background

#### What:
A game of Hide and Seek, where the players use pairs of tangible tokens. They hide the small token and use the large token to get information as of the location of the hidden token.

#### Why:
Being an activity that is easy to understand, and that can be played without the use of language, it can function as an ice-breaker and student union activity for foreign and national students.

#### For whom:
Students, new and old, foreign and national.

#### How it works
Through GPS the distance from the large token to the hiding place of the small token is calculated and makes the large token emit a LED-light signal. . The pairing of two large tokens is done through WiFi.
